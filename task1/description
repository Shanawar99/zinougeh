Create a Jenkins pipeline that automates the deployment of an EC2 instance, 
sets up MicroK8s on it, and deploys SonarQube on the MicroK8s cluster. 
You will use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, 
Ansible for configuration management, Helm for deploying SonarQube, and Python for any additional scripting required.
