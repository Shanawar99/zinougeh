## Steps for Solution

### 1) Set up an automation server that triggers on cron interval at 6AM and use bash script to perform these.

##  2) SSH into each of the server via ssh key and perform the required operations

##  3) Each step would have error handling so that it won't affect other servers operations 

##  4) For each server configurations should be in separate environment files and scp into server on execution 

##  5) Then for each server script will be executed

##  6) Run scripts in parallel for faster results
